# Smart Study Planner

A Java-based intelligent study planning and workload scheduling system that helps students distribute syllabus efficiently before exams.

## Features
- Chapter-wise study scheduling
- Priority-based subject ordering (Easy / Medium / Hard)
- Automatic workload distribution across available days
- Heavy syllabus detection and daily workload suggestion
- Progress tracking system
- Persistent storage using file handling
- Reuse of previous subjects

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File Handling (BufferedWriter, Scanner, File)
- Scheduling Algorithm

## How It Works
The program takes:
- Subjects
- Difficulty level
- Number of chapters
- Days left before exam

It then calculates an optimized plan and assigns chapters day-wise so the syllabus completes on time.

## Example Output
Day 1:
Study -> Java Chapter 1  
Study -> Java Chapter 2  

Day 2:
Study -> DBMS Chapter 1  
Study -> DBMS Chapter 2  

## Future Improvements
- GUI interface
- Web deployment
- Login system
- Performance analytics
